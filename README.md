# Weather-App-JavaScript

The weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value in Celsius unit, the weather description, and then the user's city and country. When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The icons used are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager. Link to her Repo: https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org

Thanks to CodeExplained for sharing key API
